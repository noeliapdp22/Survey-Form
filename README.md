# Survey Form

Hello! ðŸ‘‹

This is my very first project while learning web development! I created this simple survey form using **HTML** and **CSS** as part of my journey to becoming a web developer. Although it's a small project, itâ€™s a big step for me as Iâ€™m learning how to design and develop user-friendly and interactive web pages.

This form is a basic survey that asks a few questions, and itâ€™s been a great way for me to practice and improve my HTML structure and CSS styling skills. It's also my first time using **Git** and **GitHub** to manage the code and collaborate, so Iâ€™m excited to share it with you here!

## Features

- A **basic survey form** with different types of questions like text input and radio buttons.
- **Responsive design** that adjusts nicely to both desktop and mobile devices.
- Simple and **clean styling** to ensure the form is easy to use.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the form and the page.
- **CSS**: For styling the form and making it look visually appealing and user-friendly.

## How to Get Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/noeliapdp22/Survey-Form.git
    ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the form.

## Future Improvements

- I plan to expand the form with more question types like checkboxes and dropdown menus.
- Iâ€™m considering using **CSS frameworks** like Bootstrap for a more polished design.
- I may add a backend to store responses for future versions.
