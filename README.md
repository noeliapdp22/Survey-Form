# Survey on Reading Habits

This is my first project as part of my web development journey. It is a simple survey form that gathers information about users' reading habits. I created this form using **HTML** and **CSS** to practice building forms and styling them effectively.

## Features:

- A user-friendly survey form that includes:
  - Name, email, and age fields
  - Dropdown menu to select a favorite book genre
  - Number input to specify how many books are read per month
  - Radio buttons for choosing between digital or physical books
  - Checkboxes to indicate where the user prefers reading (public or home)
  - A comments section to gather additional feedback
  - A submit button to submit the form

## Future Improvements and Features:

As I continue to improve my skills, I plan to enhance this project with the following updates:

1. **Form Validation**:
   - Add more complex validation (e.g., checking if the email is in a valid format) and error messages to improve user experience.
   - Validate the minimum age input to ensure it matches the required criteria.

2. **Responsive Design**:
   - Improve the form's responsiveness to ensure it looks great on all devices, especially on mobile phones.

3. **JavaScript Integration**:
   - Add **JavaScript** functionality to provide real-time feedback when filling out the form, such as validating inputs before submission and displaying error messages inline.
   - Add an interactive progress bar that shows the completion percentage as the user fills out the form.

4. **User Feedback**:
   - After the form is submitted, display a thank-you message or a summary of the user's responses.
   - Optionally, store user responses locally (using **localStorage**) or send them to a server (using **AJAX**).

5. **Styling Enhancements**:
   - Improve the formâ€™s visual design by incorporating more modern CSS features such as **CSS Grid** or **Flexbox** for layout management.
   - Enhance form animations to make the form more interactive and engaging.

6. **Accessibility Improvements**:
   - Make the form more accessible by ensuring it is usable by people with disabilities (e.g., adding **ARIA** labels and improving the contrast ratio).

7. **Backend Integration**:
   - Integrate with a backend server (using Node.js, for example) to store form data in a database.
   - Implement **user authentication** to allow users to save and view their past responses.

8. **Themes and Customization**:
   - Implement a feature where users can choose different color themes for the form (e.g., dark mode, light mode).
   - Allow users to save their preferred themes locally using **localStorage**.
